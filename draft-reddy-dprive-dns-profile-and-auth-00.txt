1.  Introduction

   The DPRIVE working group has two active documents that provide DNS
   confidentiality, DNS over DTLS [I-D.ietf-dprive-dnsodtls] and DNS
   over TLS [I-D.ietf-dprive-dns-over-tls].

   This document defines a profile of DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347] and TLS 1.2
   [RFC5246] that offers DNS privacy.  This profile defines the
   configuration options and protocol extensions to perform connection
   handshakes with the fewest round trips while maintaining privacy.  It
   also discusses mechanisms the DNS client can use to authenticate the
   server providing DNS privacy.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  (D)TLS Profile

   This section defines the profile of DNS over DTLS and of DNS over
   TLS.  Implementations compliant with this profile MUST implement all
   of the following items:

   o  Raw public keys [RFC7250], which reduce the size of the
      ServerHello, and cannot obtain certificates (e.g., DNS resolvers
      on private networks).  DNS client and DNS resolver need to support
      [RFC7250], and raw public key-based authentication mechanism

      defined in [RFC7250] can be used by the client to authenticate the
      DNS resolver.  DNS client needs to be configured with the
      SubjectPublicKeyInfo fingerprint of the DNS resolver, and;

   o  The interaction between the DNS client and the DNS server requires
      Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer
      Security (DTLS) with a ciphersuite offering confidentiality
      protection and the guidance given in [RFC7525] must be followed to
      avoid attacks on (D)TLS.

   It is RECOMMENDED to implement the following items to improve
   performance:

   o  TLS session resumption without server-side state [RFC5077], which
      eliminates the need for the server to retain cryptographic state
      for longer than necessary, and;

   o  TLS False Start [I-D.ietf-tls-falsestart], which reduces round-
      trips by allowing the TLS second flight of messages
      (ChangeCipherSpec) to also contain the (encrypted) DNS query, and;

   o  Cached Information Extension [I-D.ietf-tls-cached-info], which
      avoids transmitting the server's certificate and certificate chain
      if the client has cached that information from a previous TLS
      handshake.

4.  Authenticating the DNS Privacy Server

   DNS privacy requires encrypting the query (and response) from passive
   attacks.  Such encryption typically provides integrity protection as
   a side-effect, which means on-path attackers cannot simply inject
   bogus DNS responses.  However, to provide stronger protection from
   active attackers pretending to be the server, the server itself needs
   to be authenticated.

   To authenticate the server providing DNS privacy, the DNS client
   needs to be configured with the names or IP addresses of those DNS
   privacy servers.  The server certificate MUST contain DNS-ID
   (subjectAltName) as described in Section 4.1 of [RFC6125].  DNS names
   and IP addresses can be contained in the subjectAltName entries.  The
   client MUST use the rules and guidelines given in section 6 of
   [RFC6125] to validate the DNS server identity.

   This could be implemented by adding the certificate name to the /etc/
   resolv.conf file, such as below:

     nameserver 8.8.8.8
     certificate google-public-dns.google.com
     nameserver 208.67.220.220
     certificate resolver.opendns.com

   For DNS privacy servers that don't have a certificate trust chain
   (e.g., because they are on a home network or a corporate network),
   the configured list of DNS privacy servers can contain the Subject
   Public Key Info (SPKI) fingerprint of the DNS privacy server (i.e., a
   simple whitelist of name and SPKI fingerprint).  The public key is
   used for the same reasons HTTP pinning [RFC7469] uses the public key.
   Raw public key-based authentication mechanism defined in [RFC7250]
   can be also used to authenticate the DNS server.

   This could be implemented by adding the SPKI fingerprint to the /etc/
   resolv.conf file, such as below (line split for Internet Draft
   formatting):

     nameserver 192.168.1.1
     sha256 : "d6qzRu9zOECb90Uez27xWltNsj0e1Md7GkYYkVoZWmM="

   The only algorithm considered at this time is "sha256", i.e., the
   hash algorithm SHA256 [RFC6234]; additional algorithms may be allowed
   for use in this context in the future.  The quoted-string is a
   sequence of base 64 digits: the base64-encoded SPKI Fingerprint
   [RFC4648].

5.  Common problems with DNS Privacy

   This section describes problems common to any DNS privacy solution.
   To achieve DNS privacy an encrypted and integrity-protected channel
   is needed between the client and server.  This channel can be
   blocked, and the client needs to react to such blockages.  The
   encrypted traffic is not normal DNS traffic, but rather is a
   cryptographic handshake followed by encrypted payloads.  There can be
   firewalls, other security devices, or intercepting DNS proxies which
   block the non-DNS traffic or otherwise react negatively (e.g.,
   quarantining the host for suspicious behavior).

   Using DNS privacy with an authenticated server is most preferred, DNS
   privacy with an unauthenticated server is next preferred, and plain
   DNS is least preferred.  This section gives a non-normative
   discussion on common behaviors and choices.

   An implementation MAY attempt to obtain DNS privacy by contacting DNS
   servers on the local network (provided by DHCP) and on the Internet,
   and make those attempts in parallel to reduce user impact.  If DNS
   privacy cannot be successfully negotiated for whatever reason, the
   client can do three things:

   1.  refuse to send DNS queries on this network, which means the
       client cannot make effective use of this network, as modern
       networks require DNS; or,

   2.  use opportunistic security, as described in [RFC7435]. or,

   3.  send plain DNS queries on this network, which means no DNS
       privacy is provided.

   Heuristics can improve this situation, but only to a degree (e.g.,
   previous success of DNS privacy on this network may be reason to
   alert the user about failure to establish DNS privacy on this network
   now).  Still, the client (in cooperation with the end user) has to
   decide to use the network without the protection of DNS privacy.

6.  IANA Considerations

   None.

7.  Security Considerations

   With opportunistic privacy, a client might learn of a (D)TLS-enabled
   recursive DNS resolver from an untrusted source (such as DHCP while
   roaming), it might or might not validate the TLS certificate.  These
   choices maximize availability and performance, but they leave the
   client vulnerable to on-path attacks that remove privacy.
   Opportunistic privacy can be used by any current client, but it only
   provides guaranteed privacy when there are no on-path active
   attackers.

   Security considerations discussed in DTLS [RFC7435] and TLS [RFC7435]
   apply to this document.
